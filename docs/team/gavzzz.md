### Project: REal-Time

REal-Time is a desktop application for _Real-Estate agents_ to manage client information, schedule meetings,
and track client offers and listings.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added ability to add, delete, edit and find clients.
  * What it does: allows the user to add new clients to the address book, edit their information, find the client and
delete the client if they want to.
   * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because as a real estate agent, they need to manage
their clients and allows them to freely manipulate their clients information.
   * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. As the Person class was too generic, having a Client class would be more specific and
future commands would make use of the Client class instead.
