### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for
the scenario where the user issues the command `delC 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API
`interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality
using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given
component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled
to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`,
`PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract
`UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files
that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout
of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java)
is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Client` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `RealTimeParser` class to parse the user command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddClientCommand`)
which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delC 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for
`DeleteClientCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline
reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `RealTimeParser` class creates an
`XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddClientCommandParser`) which uses the
other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddClientCommand`) which the
`RealTimeParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddClientCommandParser`, `DeleteOfferCommandParser`, ...) inherit from
the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the data in RealTime i.e., all `Client`, `Offer`, `Listing` and `Meeting` objects (which are contained in a
`UniqueClientList`, `UniqueOfferList`, `UniqueListingList` and `UniqueMeetingList` object respectively).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Client`, `Offer`, `Listing` and `Meeting` objects (e.g., results of a search query)
as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Client>`,
`ObservableList<Offer>`, `ObservableList<Listing>` and `ObservableList<Meeting>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI
can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a
`ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain,
they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `RealTime`, which `Person` references. This allows `RealTime` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both RealTime data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `RealTimeStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.realtime.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedRealTime`. It extends `RealTime` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `RealTimeStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedRealTime#commit()` — Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedRealTime#undo()` — Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedRealTime#redo()` — Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitRealTime()`, `Model#undoRealTime()` and `Model#redoRealTime()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedRealTime` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitRealTime()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `realTimeStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitRealTime()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `realTimeStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitRealTime()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `realTimeStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoRealTime()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial RealTime state, then there are no previous RealTime states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoRealTime()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoRealTime()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `realTimeStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone realTime states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoRealTime()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitRealTime()`, `Model#undoRealTime()` or `Model#redoRealTime()`. Thus, the `realTimeStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitRealTime()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `realTimeStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

### \[Implemented\] Add Offer feature

#### Offers

REal-Time manages **_Offers_** made by Clients that are interested when bidding for Listings. To model an

#### Implementation

To add an `Offer` object, the `AddOfferCommand` must be executed. This stores the `Offer` object into the
`UniqueOfferList`. Following the command execution pathway, the implementation of adding offers uses the exposed
`Model#addOffer(Offer)` method in the `Model` API.

The `AddOfferCommand` is parsed by the `AddOfferCommandParser`.
`AddOfferCommandParser#parse()` parses the user input to return a `AddOfferCommand` object that will be executed.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add offers mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user opens up the `REal-Time` application for the first time and observes that there are some sample data
in the `UniqueOfferList`.

Step 2. The user keys in the command word for adding an offer, `addO`, followed by the compulsory parameters needed to
add an offer, namely the `Name` component prefixed by `n/`, `Price` component prefixed by `o/` and the `ListingId`
component prefixed by `l/`. In this scenario, the user keys in `addO n/John Doe l/BEDOK_SOUTH o/600000` into the command box
which will execute the `AddOfferCommandParser` to check through the arguments and ensure that the compulsory fields are
present. It will then create the `Price`, `ListingId` and `Name` objects needed to instantiate an `Offer` object. The
parser returns a `AddOfferCommand` object with the `Offer` object ready to be added into `Model`

Step 3. The `AddOfferCommand` calls the `Model#addOffer(Offer)` to add the offer and its relevant attributes.

Step 4. Depending on whether the `UniqueOfferList` already contains data or is an empty list, the added Offer will
be sorted automatically by the `ListingId` in lexicographical order. This is done using the `Collections#sort()` method
and implementing a natural order by implementing the `Comparable` interface and overriding the `Comparable#compareTo()`
method.

The sequence diagram below shows the add offer process.

![addOfferSequenceDiagram](images/AddOfferSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for
`AddOfferCommandParser` and `RealTimeParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline
reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: Client-Offer interaction**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Seperate Offers and Client objects
  * Pros: Easier to maintain as they are seperate objects, less dependency between each other
  * Cons: No reference between the `Client` and `Offer` objects
* **Alternative 2:** Allow Clients to have an Offer attribute instead
  * Pros: Easier to reference between `Client` and `Offer`
  * Cons: Large dependency between the two.

### \[Implemented\] Delete Offer feature

The Delete Offer feature allows users to delete the specified `Offer` in the `UniqueOfferList`.

#### Implementation

To delete an `Offer` object, the `DeleteOfferCommand` must be executed. The `DeleteOfferCommand` extends the `Command`
class.

The `DeleteOfferCommand` is parsed by the `DeleteOfferCommandParser`. `DeleteOfferCommandParser#parse()` parses the user
input to return a `DeleteOfferCommand` that will be executed.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the delete offer mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user enters `delO 1` in the command box.  This calls the `LogicManager#execute()` method which calls the
`RealTimeParser#parse` method to be executed and will determine that the command is a `DeleteOfferCommand` after parsing.

Step 2. A `DeleteOfferCommandParser` object is instantiated with the necessary arguments. It will return a
`DeleteOfferCommand` object with the specified `Index`.

Step 3. The `DeleteOfferCommand#execute()` method is called which calls the `Model#deleteOffer(Offer)` method to delete
the Offer at the specified `Index` in `Model`.

The sequence diagram below shows the delete offer process.

![deleteOfferSequenceDiagram](images/DeleteOfferSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for
`DeleteOfferCommandParser` and `DeleteOfferCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline
reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: Using index specific or attribute specific deletion**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Index specific
    * Pros: Easier implementation and more suited for fast-typing
    * Cons: Might accidentally delete the wrong `Offer` if `Index` is mistyped
* **Alternative 2:** Attribute specific
    * Pros: User does not have to find for specific `Index`
    * Cons: Many `Offer` objects might share same attribute such as `ListingId` and `Price`

### \[Implemented\] Edit Offer feature

The Edit Offer feature allows users to edit any attribute of an `Offer` in the `UniqueOfferList`.

#### Implementation

To edit an `Offer`, the `EditOfferCommand` is executed. The `EditOfferCommand` extends the `Command` class.

The `EditOfferCommand` is parsed by the `EditOfferCommandParser`. `EditOfferCommandParser#parse()` parses the user input
to return a `EditOfferCommand` that will be executed.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the edit offer mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user enters `editO 1 l/Bukit_timah_rd o/1000000` in the command box. This calls the `LogicManager#execute()`
method which calls the `RealTimeParser#parse` method to be executed and will determine that the command is a
`EditOfferCommand` after parsing.

Step 2. An `EditOfferCommandParser` object is instantiated with the necessary arguments. It returns a `EditOfferCommand`
with the `Index` and `EditOfferDescriptor` as parameters. The `EditOfferDescriptor` contains the edited information that
the edited `Offer` is supposed to be updated to. In this scenario, we are changing the `listingId` and `Price` attribute
of the `Offer`. The `EditOfferDescriptor` is then updated through the `setListing()` and `setOfferPrice()` methods by
the `EditOfferDescriptor`.

Step 3. The `EditOfferCommand#execute()` method is called which creates the edited `Offer` using the `createEditedOffer`
method which takes in the `Offer` to be edited and the `EditOfferDescriptor` that was created from the previous step.
The edited `Offer` is then checked if it is a duplicate or already exists in the `UniqueOfferList` through the
`Offer#isSameOffer()` and `Model#hasOffer()` methods.

An `Offer` is the same if it contains the exact same `Name`, `Price` and `ListingId`.

Step 4. The `Model#setOffer(Offer)` method is called to replace the target `Offer` at the specified `Index` from earlier.
The `Model#updateFilteredOfferList()` is called to update the `UniqueOfferList`.
