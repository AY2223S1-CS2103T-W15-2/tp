# Introduction

Welcome to the REal-Time User Guide!


REal-Time is a desktop application for _Real-Estate agents_ to manage client information, schedule meetings,
and track client offers and listings.

_[More to be added]_

## About REal-Time

It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface ([CLI](#Glossary)) while still having the 
benefits of a Graphical User Interface ([GUI](#Glossary)). 
If you can type fast, REal-Time can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

## Fun fact
The **"REa"** in **REal-Time** stands for _Real-Estate agents_, which is the intended target user of our application!

## Using this guide

Now that you have read the introduction and learnt about what our product does, get started in using REal-Time by
following the guide provided in the [Quick Start](#quick-start) section. Otherwise,
* If you are still unsure of the commands used in REal-Time, the [Command Summary](#command-summary) is a good place to 
start.
* The [Prefix Summary](#prefix-summary) and [Glossary](#glossary) are also great places to understand REal-Time
better.
* If you are a developer and would like to help improve our product, take a look at our [Developer Guide](https://ay2223s1-cs2103t-w15-2.github.io/tp/DeveloperGuide.html).

# Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `addC n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `addC n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
